# SignCopyLite
 Super quick and easy tool for copying and editing signs in Spigot 1.8.x (since Spigot 1.8.x strips signs in your inventory of data)
 
## Usage
 Simply download the .jar from the releases tab and put it into your Spigot 1.8.x servers plugin folder.
 When ingame you can type /scl to receive the tool and a quick description of how the command works.
 There is another description for the tool when you hover over the item.

## Permissions
 The only permission needed is "SignCopyLite", which doesn't matter if you're an operator
