# SignCopyLite
 Super quick and easy tool for copying and editing signs in Spigot 1.8.x (since Spigot 1.8.x strips signs in your inventory of data)
 
## Usage
 Simply download the .jar from the releases tab and put it into your Spigot 1.8.x servers plugin folder.<br>
 When ingame you can type /scl (or /signcopylite) to receive the tool and a quick description of how the command works.<br>
 Using the tool you can right-click to copy a text from a sign and left-click to paste it to another sign.<br>
 If you'd like to set the text that should be pasted, you can simply use "/scl <text>".<br>
 The text is seperated into lines using "\n" and can be color-coded using the "&"-sign.

## Permissions
 The only permission needed is "SignCopyLite", which doesn't matter if you're an operator
